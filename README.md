# Image Picker Demo

Image gallery with fullscreen.

## Getting Started
    - clone git repo
    - run flutter app on device or simulator
    - add file read permissions
    - start with an image gallery where you can chose between your local image files

## TODOS
    - tests and final implementations on iOS
    - improve file caching
    - extract classes and widgets in separate files
    - add videos to gallery
    - catch memory leaks on older devices
    - improve UX for access permissions
    - catch empty galleries
